-- W3C and Accessibility --

The HTML of the new website is 99% XHTML 1.0 Strict valid.
The only element that is not valid is an iFrame in the contact section that generates 4 errors.
The CSS file is also valid, besides some CSS3 code in the beginning that is used to stretch the background image, which generates 3 errors.
The website was successfully tested for accessibility with two different services. 
The only issue that came up were the input fields on the contact page, which don't have a label since their description is already visible in the input field.

-- Usability --

The Usability Survey was completed by 5 participants.
