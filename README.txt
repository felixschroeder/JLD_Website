Johnson Landscape Design

-- Essay --

Large clients often have existing style guides to which web designers and developers have to stick to. 
However when it comes to redesigning a website or creating a new web presence, the following question comes up: 
Does the designer fit the client’s product to his vision of design, or does he fit his design to the client’s vision of the product? 
This is not an easy decision and project partners often get in conflict about it before the project has even begun. 
The client wants to see his product in the shiniest light and therefore has his own ideas how to present it. 
The designer knows about rules, possibilities and the right way to serve the client’s needs. 
Nevertheless it’s important for the designer to listen to the client’s ideas and to involve him during the whole process. 
But when it comes to essential decisions regarding structure and design the designer should have the last word since he has better understanding of this field. 
However, who pays makes the rules and in fact the last instance is mostly the client. 
This is why I think that in the end the designer is the one who has to fit his design to the client’s vision if the product. 
But still, in the role of a consultant, the designer can try to inform the client and state reasons for his steps and ideas to prevent damage.
The new website of Johnson Landscapes was designed in close collaboration with the client and was improved throughout several sessions of review. 
Elements, colours and graphics were carefully selected to express the client’s vision of the company. 

In the case of Johnson Landscape Design, the client’s “products” are different landscaping services. 
The first colours one would associate with landscaping are probably green (trees, bushes, grass) and brown (trees, earth, soil). 
So I chose these as the main colours for the design. The main background of the page should somehow be quiet and not distracting but at the same time not too boring. 
So I chose a lawn with different levels of brightness and shadows. 
To connect the background with the content area I decided to use partly lucent colours through which users can still see the lines of the shadows. 
Since the client asked for a redesign of his old logo, I tried to find associations with landscaping. 
The very first idea that came into my mind was a three dimensional tree. I made a first draft of the tree that accompanied the name of the company. 
The client didn’t like it since he considered it too abstract and too complex. 
So I tried to think smaller and ended up with a leaf that was attached to the letter J of the word Johnson. 
But the client wasn’t satisfied yet and he thought that the logo now looks too simple, doesn’t look like a leaf and has the wrong colour. 
After a third round of improvement I ended up with the current version, which has three leaves instead of one and two different main colours and finally the client was satisfied.
The client wanted the new website to be “state of the art” and it should differentiate him from competitors. 
To show the client’s customers that Johnson Landscape Design is a modern and customer friendly company, I made use of modern web technologies and the latest design elements. 
The homepage of the new website provides the visitor with everything that is important in the first place. 
On top of the page, a ribbon with a nice slogan points in the direction of the Logo. 
The vertical menu was designed to look natural and it wasn’t easy to find a solution that integrates well with the rest of the page design. 
The main banner, which is different on each site, directs the eye to the “get in touch” - button which links to the contact page. 
The user can also explore the different services that are offered on the first sight. For more detailed information he can scroll down to see the “Find out more” - buttons for each of the services. 
To make it easy for visitors to establish a connection to the company, the contact details and the social services were included in the footer and therefore appear on every page. 
To establish a personal environment which is essential for long-term client relationships, pictures, personal statements and information of the Johnson Landscape staff and on the company were included. 
In the service section the visitor can access information on the different landscaping services and get an idea of what can be accomplished through the pictures. 
If the client wants to see more detailed examples of the work that Johnson Landscaping Design provides, he can click on the buttons to be directed to the portfolio section. 

With the new website, one of the client’s main goals is to promote previous projects. 
Therefore I created the portfolio page that provides the visitor with a deeper insight into projects and shows a broad range of work examples with detailed descriptions. 
By hovering over the thumbnails the visitor can view 12 different pictures of previous projects. 
The contact section also found its place in the main menu so users can navigate there directly to find out how to contact the company. 
Next to the contact details I included an interactive street map to help visitors finding the company. 
In this project, the designer enjoyed the freedom to work almost independently and was therefore given the chance to fit his vision of design onto the product, however not completely without restraints. 
In larger projects, where content management systems, internationalization, company guidelines, different product designs, performance and different opinions matter, the vision of the designer has to queue up behind more important factors.

-- W3C and Accessibility --

The HTML of the new website is 99% XHTML 1.0 Strict valid.
The only element that is not valid is an iFrame in the contact section that generates 4 errors.
The CSS file is also valid, besides some CSS3 code in the beginning that is used to stretch the background image, which generates 3 errors.
The website was successfully tested for accessibility with two different services. 
The only issue that came up was the input fields on the contact page, which don’t have a label since the description is already included in the input field.
